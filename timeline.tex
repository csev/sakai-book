Sakai 1.5 Release: March 25, 2005\\
Performance fixes\\
Group Provider\\
Realm Provider\\
Samigo released separately\\
Rewritten internal aggregator (Varuna) supporting gallery mode of Sakai\\
Syllabus, Help, and Profile Tools\\
Emergent new Sakai APIs.\\

The Sakai 2.0 rewrite started promptly in January as QA and other issues were worked out for 1.5.  The 1.5 release came out with Samigo as an add-on as we simply ran out of time.  The 1.5.1 release came out later with Samigo integrated in a single release.  Sakai 1.5.1 was the last release where we released *after* the software was in production.  A number of sites took Sakai 1.5.1 and put it in production - OSP 2.0 was based on this Sakai release.

2005-06-02 Note to John Ellis - Rob and I are hatching an idea to try an OSPI 2.0 / Sakai 2.0 merge starting June 15.  We should talk on the phone.

As Sakai 2.0 came together - the framework looked very nice - there had been extensive design documentation written as Sakai 2.0 was developed.  In April and May we moved the applications from the Sakai 1.5 framework to the Sakai 2.0 framework.  This was the first Sakai integration Week May 16-20, 2005 - where the Sakai teams assembled and performed the final integration of the tools into the 2.0 release.  Sakai 2.0 was released June 15, 2006 - right on schedule.  Sakai 2.0 was the first Sakai release that (a) happened on schedule and (b) happened before it was put into production.  Many schools installed Sakai 2.0.

Sakai 2.0 Release: June 15, 2005\\
Tools 80\%  style guide compliant\\
New internal aggregator - Charon\\
Improved Skin\\
Completely re-written framework 2.0\\
Internationalization\\
Gradebook\\
Web Services Support\\
Architecture design documents\\
Development overlapped between 1.5 and 2.0\\
Coordinated Community QA\\
Improved install documentation\\

The Sakai 2.0 release began a transition in technical approach and governance as Sakai prepared for the transition to the "post-project" phase.  Increasingly developers and QA folks from outside the core team were becoming involved in the development and release of the product.  With a stable framework for the first time, the whole project was quite productive.  A decision had been made to merge the source trees of the Open Source Portfolio and Sakai projects so as to have a sustainability model for the OSP code after the OSP grant finished.   Over the summer, Indiana University produced a version of Sakai 2.0 that also included OSP 2.0.

2005-06-11 OSPI decides to merge into Sakai in terms of governance and let the OSPI governance cease at the end of the year

A large number of sites came up for the North American Fall semester.  Indiana University tried to shift nearly their whole population into Sakai.   This led to some performance tuning "opportunities" and showed that the Samigo product has significant weaknesses and issues with scaling.
