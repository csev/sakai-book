This book describes the experiences of building the
open-source Sakai teaching and learning environment 
from the inside.  

Sakai is an ambitious open source project 
founded by the University of Michigan, 
Indiana University, Stanford University,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the
Open Knowledge Initiative(OKI), and the uPortal
Project.  The Sakai project was funded by the 
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, The William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation, and over 100 Sakai partner
schools and companies for over five million dollars
over a two year period.  The six founding partners were quickly
joined by the University of California Berkeley,
Foothill College, the University of Lleida, Cambridge 
University, and many others.

The project was very ambitious with an almost impossible
schedule for delivery.  Almost nothing in the project
went according to the plans and yet today, the Sakai
software is in use at nearly 300 schools world wide
with three million daily users and a ten percent 
market share of research universities in 2010.

This is the story of the successes and failures and
recoveries along the way as well as the joy and sadness
as the project went forward with a decidedly 
insider perspective.
Charles Severance was the chief architect
of the Sakai proejct during 2004 and 2005 and 
was the executive director of the Sakai Foundation
during 2006 and 2007.  He has been on the board of 
directors of the Sakai Foundation since 2010
continues contribute to the Sakai software effort.
